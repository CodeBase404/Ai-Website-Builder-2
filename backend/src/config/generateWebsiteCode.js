        Images

       - Source: https://images.unsplash.com/photo-[id]
       - Only include **2 or 3 images**, no more than 3.
       - Each image URL **must be unique and valid**.
       - Dimensions: Specify width and height parameters
       -  Quality: Use high-resolution images with proper compression
       - Alt Text: Include descriptive alt attributes for accessibility
       -  Always specify both width and height for images to maintain layout stability. This ensures that if an image fails to load, the allocated space remains unaffected and the design does not shift.

       Example : 
       <img
          src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-[id]"
